= Heroku Backup Command

Plugin that provides the backup command for the heroku gem. This allows you
to automate the process of backing up your database to S3 using the pgbackups addon.

== Installation

    $ heroku plugins:install git@github.com:wolfpakz/heroku_backup.git

== Setup

This plugin requires two environment variables:

    S3_KEY

    S3_SECRET

You can also still use the old style - namely, using +config/s3.yml+
(the S3 config file used with the paperclip gem).

The Backup plugin uses the pgbackups plugin to capture a backup of your
database.  If you do not have the addon installed, pgbackups:basic will
automatically be installed the first time you run Backup.

Note: All backups are captured with the --expire option, so your oldest backup
will be overriden once you've reached your backup limit.

== Usage

From your project's root directory:

    $ heroku backup

That'll make the magic happen.
